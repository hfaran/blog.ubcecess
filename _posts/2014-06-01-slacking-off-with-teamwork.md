## Investigating the Alternatives

I took some time to look at alternatives. Trello isn't actually as bad as I may have
espoused in my earlier rant. I'm not going to say that we could do a lot worse than Trello,
because while we probably could, my anecdotes suggest that most project management
 tools exist on a similar plane of mediocrity and can be described by a single adjective; usable. Full stop.

That being said, let's go through them anyways; maybe we'll actually find something
that exceeds my not-really-that-high expectations.

## The Simple, The Unsuitable, and BaseCamp

As you can imagine, most of them didn't. First contender up is...

### [DoneDone](http://www.getdonedone.com/)

![Red Flag!](/images/slacking_teamwork/donedone.png)

I perhaps should have stopped right when I saw that. As you may have guessed,
something advertising itself as "simple" was likely not going to fulfill our needs. The breakdown on DoneDone:

* **No subtasks**; issue linking is no better than Trello really
* It is **really pretty** and uses Markdown... but the same can be said of Trello
* **Expensive** at [$588/yr for 50 users](http://www.getdonedone.com/plans-pricing/) which is the plan we would need

In the end DoneDone isn't a particularly attractive choice and not really worth looking at.

### [BaseCamp](https://basecamp.com)

Oh really? Favorite, you say? Well then, this must be it; we've found it! ... Right?

**HAH!**

[No dependencies. No dice.](https://help.37signals.com/basecamp/questions/225-does-basecamp-support-task-dependencies)

That's it. Bye Basecamp. No seriously, I want a tool that has **some** kind of dependency system between tasks (especially if we're going to pay money for it).

### [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)

Subtasks and dependencies, yes please. JIRA would be fantastic to have (as would the rest of the Atlassian suite).

There's just one problem as between us and that, are either $1200 or a really fantastic application for a non-profit license depending on how we play our cards.

It all looks so grim.


## But It Gets Better

Why does it get better? Slack + Teamwork.

### [Teamwork](https://www.teamwork.com/)

Don't watch the cheesy intro video. It's a disservice to the actual product. The actual product is **fantastic** and blows everything else ([BaseCamp for sure](http://geekyscribbles.com/basecamp-vs-teamwork-pm-why-we-packed-up-camp-and-moved/)) I've looked at out of the water.

Task dependencies in this are **present** and better than I could have expected:

* There are task lists
* Tasks are created inside task lists
* Tasks can have dependencies on other tasks
* Tasks can **also** have subtasks!
    * Even subtasks can have assignees!
* Obligatory mention of [markdown support for comments](http://engineroom.teamwork.com/messages-and-comments-now-support-formatting-with-markdown/)

At [$28/month for 15 projects w/ Google Drive integration](https://www.teamwork.com/pricing), Teamwork, to me, is looking like a winner.

### And [Slack](www.slack.com)?

So far, I have been talking exclusively about project management tools. And on that front, I am convinced Teamwork is the Trello replacement we are looking for. But there is another area where we could do better, and that is internal communication.

Last year, we used an awkward combination of email, Facebook chat, and Trello.

Awkward because email is just an awkward communication medium in general, between of the semi-enforced, semi-embraced formalism and the usual formatting strawman.

Facebook chat is just stickers all the time.

Trello comments are okay, and great in the fact that if you are having a conversation in the comments of the relevant card, the information is at least properly contextualized. But, to throw ideas around or for brainstorming, it just simply isn't instant, and therefore lackluster.

**[Enter Slack.](https://slack.com/is)**

I'm assuming after going through the tour, you are already convinced that we need Slack in our lives. If not, let me reiterate some things and go over my vision of Slack for us:

* Channels. We can actually have conversations relevant to a certain topic. #siliconvalley, #arcademachine, #stickerspamfest2014; we can have it all.
* Integration with the services we already love and use
    * You can start a hangout in a channel just by typing `/hangout`. HOW COOL IS THAT?
    * Google Drive docs, when pasted in, will be fully indexable (by contents and title) with Slack's search
    * If we choose to use Trello, that is integrated too
    *
* Slack has mobile apps for iOS and Android that replicate the web UI and all it's functionality really well
* We get it for free (with limitations of: maximum 5 integrations, 10,000 searchable messages, 5GB storage, which are reasonable)


## Moving Forward

I have seen the future. It exists at [ubcecess.slack.com](https://ubcecess.slack.com) and [ubcecess.teamwork.com](https://ubcecess.teamwork.com).

Let me know if you guys are onboard.
